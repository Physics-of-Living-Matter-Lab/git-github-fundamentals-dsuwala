Hi!

I'm 1st year Master's on MISMaP with physics as main degree. My interests 
focus on computational physics where I had a taste with various things: from 
ground state DFT with spin-orbit correction through excited states simulations 
with both TD-DFT and BSE methods and finally MD in which I like the most and I
think I will stay there longer. Currently I work at the Institute of Biophysics
and Biochemistry with both proteins and nucleic acids small-ligands MD which 
includes also docking before. 
If you are interested I can talk all day about what we do there, so I 
encourage you to ask ;)

My another huge interests is linux itself. I was using arch as my main OS few 
months, but I also compiled gentoo and in the next week as fast as I will find
time I'm going to compile LFS on hardware. 
LFS == Linux from Scratch, which is compilation of all the linux components 
including kernel directly from source code which is publicly available

Best, 
Dominik
