# Hi!
I was a bit confused for a moment about profile README, but now it's fine. Don't 
know what to write here. 

I had previous github experience, but not that much as I would like to, but I 
really like the idea to use it during this course. I hope we will use it as much 
as possible, so I can practice it. Especially I would like to learn best 
practices regarding commit messages
